This is a story about a yankee who gives a bad impression of being a yankee and gives advice and help to people in need.

The story is about a yankee who takes care of an abandoned cat, and the gap between the two gives him a good impression.
But the author's creative ability to add a twist to it and make it into a system that can be used in each story is amazing.
## The idea of one-point advice is brilliant!
The way the story is created is very careful and pleasant to read.

The basic flow of the story is as follows

The story is about a mob of people who are frustrated with their lives and inwardly vent their frustrations on a yankee.
2. something happens that annoys the mob
The Yankee solves the problem and gives a word of advice.
The mob develops a good feeling for the Yankee.

This is the template.

The first part of the story, where the mob is stressed and antagonistic, is something I can relate to.
The quality of the manga is stable.

The quality of the manga is consistently high, which shows the author's ability.

However, the author's ability is not limited to the quality of his works.
But the author's ability lies not only in the quality of his work, but also in the fact that he has created a system that allows him to mass produce that quality.

## A system that can create an infinite number of gaps
One of the advantages of this template is that you can create as many stories as you want with as much advice (trivia) as you want.

The steps to create a story are

First, look up the trivia.
2. think of a situation (trouble) where that trivia can be used.
3. think about how the trouble happens.
4. think about the parties involved in the trouble.

By filling in the story template in reverse order, it is possible to mass produce a consistent story.

In this method, the number of trivia becomes the number of stories.

Also, by introducing new trivia each time, it is possible to answer the expectations of the readers beyond their imagination.

In addition, it is possible to create a set of psychological events, such as the resolution of a specific problem and the improvement of the reader's impression of the Yankee.

From a storytelling standpoint, this is a great invention.

## I thought it would be all one-shot stories.
But don't you get bored with the same kind of development? Some people may think so.

In order to solve this problem, as the series progresses, elements of a full-length story appear.

- The protagonist's past is a mystery
  - This is what makes it so interesting.
  - However, because it's a mystery, it supports the fact that the protagonist appears everywhere.
- The romantic elements of the main character and other characters
  - He looks like a yankee and his first impression is terrible! He seems to be a saintly man who is an all-around good guy who helps people like no other, but he's not very good at love.

## As the book progresses, the direction of the story is set and it becomes more interesting.
- An ironclad template structure that makes the story solid
- High manga ability
- The existence of a strong creative system
- As the series continues, elements of a longer story are added.

Personally, I like this manga a lot.
