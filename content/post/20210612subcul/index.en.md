R: I've recently become interested in something called NFT.

TARKY: Yeah, I gave it a try.

R: What's it like?

tarky: Right now I'm stuck at creating an account, but I wonder if it's that different from trading virtual currency.

R: I'm not sure about the virtual currency trading, though.

tarky: First, you open an account at an NFT exchange and deposit virtual currency into it.

Then you use the virtual currency to buy collections (works of art linked to virtual currency).

R: What happens to the purchased data?

Tarky: What happens to the data? I don't know how to view it yet.

R : I think it's a breakthrough in the sense that it gives uniqueness to digital data.

tarky: I don't know. Is there any value in unique digital data?

R: The value of a work of art is in the fact that it was created by the artist, isn't it?

tarky: I think that's just the history of monetization for the old artists.

Nowadays, there are many ways to send money, such as patrons and spacers, aren't there? So
Do you want to buy that kind of unique data?

R: Well, that's exactly what happened in the past with music piracy and manga villages. Wouldn't this be a counter to that?

Tarky: It won't, will it? I don't think there's a causal relationship between the ability to exchange unique data and the distribution of pirated copies.

R: Then the only use for it now is for capitalists to escape taxes, right?

tarky: I think the fact that it is easy to transfer money is in line with the original idea of virtual currency. Well, since it conflicts with the monetary policy to stabilize the value of money, isn't it regulated in China, for example?

R: Hmm.

## Overview
- NFT
  - Linking virtual currency tokens and data
  - Rather than virtual currency, this is an application of blockchain.
  - Other applications include university transcripts.
  - However, as a characteristic of blockchain technology, it is necessary to keep the miner running, and in this sense, the well-known ethereum is mostly used (2021).
  - A history of transactions will ensure the originality of the token.
  - Ordinary people can issue NFTs.
    - Need to issue an account on an NFT exchange
    - In addition, they need to apply for a creator account
  - Question
    - What kind of data can be used?
      - Many are 3d art. In principle, any kind of data is possible?
    - Is there any value in the originality of the data?
      - In the case of music, p2p, streaming services, etc. have emerged.
      - I feel that just because NFT has a high conceptual affinity with the way artists have historically acquired funding, it's not the only way.
      - There are other ways to support artists besides purchasing.
      - Patreon, Spacha, etc.
    - Can purchases be made in cash?
      - Purchases can be made in virtual currency.
    - Doesn't pricing in virtual currency involve the risk of fluctuations in the value of the work?
      - There is a risk of fluctuations in the virtual currency itself.
      - There is a possibility that the virtual currency will stop.
      - Currently, there is concern about the problem of high transaction fees for ethereum
    - Are there prospects for widespread adoption?
      - It will never be widely used.
      - In the first place, there is no culture of buying art in the city.
      - Isn't there a strong aspect of asset investment and tax avoidance for wealthy individuals?
        - The application of virtual currency as a means of inexpensive international remittance has been a principle of virtual currency since the beginning, so naturally the avoidance of costs, including taxes, must have been taken into consideration.
      - Will laws regarding virtual currencies become more widespread?
        - Some countries are regulating it, while others are incorporating it into legal tender.
      - Is there any practical use for it?
        - Virtual currency can be used to purchase Tesla cars, credit cards are being issued in virtual currency, and it is becoming possible to use it in everyday business transactions.
    - Will it lead to environmental problems?
      - The most effective way is to force China to regulate its carbon dioxide emissions. It is not essential to turn a blind eye to this point and only have opinions on other measures.
        - Well, it's hard to force China to do something when it is a permanent member of the UN and has veto power.
      - When it comes to power consumption, aren't we ignoring the existence of data centers?
      - Who can judge which power consumption is necessary and which is unnecessary?
