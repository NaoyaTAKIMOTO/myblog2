## Dialogue
R: I don't understand soccer at all, but you can talk a lot, can't you tarky?

R: I don't know anything about soccer, but you can talk a lot, can't you? tarky: That's because I used to go to the home games of my favorite clubs quite often.

Hanasana: In Hiroshima, there's Sanfrecce Hiroshima. A recent topic for Sanfrecce Hiroshima is the Emperor's Cup. In soccer, from the top to the bottom, there is J1, J2, J3, and JFL, and there was a giant-killing when they were trounced 1-5 by a team from the fifth division.

R: Is that supposed to be an unbelievable story?

tarky: It's just like a good student at Nada High School being trounced by an ordinary public school student in a mock exam. In baseball, it's like a professional losing to an amateur.

Hanasana: The interesting thing about the tournament system is that such a huge upset can happen. However, Hiroshima's tactics themselves are not very interesting because they play with a solid defense and a strong foreigner who scores goals.

tarky: It's interesting to see how each club has different core tactics and how far they are willing to go to win. In soccer, the tactics of a team change depending on various factors, so one of the ways to enjoy soccer is to consider these factors. It's interesting to see how the relationship between the players really manifests itself. In baseball, you can see how good the catcher is at various positions.

R: There are many cultural differences between baseball and soccer, aren't there? I think there are a lot of player transfers in soccer.

R: I think there are a lot of player transfers in soccer. Hanasana: According to some people, professional baseball is a job in the baseball world, while professional soccer is a private business. You seek a club with good conditions for you, and it's normal to have an agent.
