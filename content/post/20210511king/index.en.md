## I wanted to draw King Halo sweating and practicing.
Elements I wanted to include

- jersey
- profile
- Sweat wiping action
- King Halo
- The weather is bad
- Putting color in shadows and eyes

## Impressions

- The profile doesn't look good unless you have the right materials.
- I don't understand the shoulder area.
- I don't know how to describe the long hair
- I can't get the background to look like rain.
- I wonder if I can get the pose right by drawing the whole body and then trimming it.

## Fixes
{{<tweet 1391897385538768896>}}

- Fixed the position of the eyes.
- Fix the mouth.

## Do I need to be creative to express King Halo's duality?
Uma Musume has become killer content.
There are a lot of illustrations out there that could be used as models, so let's start by studying them, shall we?
