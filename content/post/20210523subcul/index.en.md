R: "Speaking of which, the escaped python in Yokohama was found in the attic [^1].

[^1]: A captive python escaped in Yokohama. Dozens of police officers were mobilized to search for it.


tarky: "Well, even if the snake doesn't have any intention of harming you, it has the power to kill a person. I think there was a video of Mutsugoro almost being strangled to death by a snake.

R: "It's like one rat in a big pile of rats.

Tarky: "Well, there was a UMA writer or something about this. R: "It's like a big mountain rumbling, but with one rat. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. [^2]

R: "Well, when it comes to creatures that we have some idea of inhabiting, there is no way to search for them.

Tarky: "What do you mean?

R: "Well, there is something called environmental DNA. R: "There's a technology called environmental DNA, which can search for DNA in river water to see if it contains specific gene sequences.

Tarky: "Wait. What is environmental DNA?

R: "It means that the animal's excrement also contains cells from its intestines
R: "It means that even if the animal's excrement contains cells in the intestines or has been eaten and digested by other predators, there is still some kind of DNA left. We have technology to amplify it and read it.

Tarky: "Is it, um, PCR or something to amplify the DNA?

R: "It's a long story, so I'll cut it short, but something like that.

R: "That's a long story, so I'll skip it this time, but that's about it." tarky: "Huh, they used to set up a national project to read the human genome [^3].

[^3]:A project to analyze the human genetic sequence. [^3]: A project to analyze the genetic sequence of a person, which took an enormous amount of people and time. [Human Genome Project](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%92%E3%83%88%E3%82%B2%E3%83%8E%E3%83%A0%E8%A8%88%E7%94%BB)

R: "Well, it costs about 100,000 yen and takes a few weeks, so it's not that easy to ask for help.

R: "Well, it costs about 100,000 yen and takes a few weeks, so it's not so easy to ask for help.

R: "By the way, this can also be applied to humans, and if you use sewage or something, you can identify the race of the people living there.

Tarky: "What? Race? Can you identify the race?

R: "Yes, you can. R: "Yes, especially the Y chromosome, which has the most powerful information to identify individuals.
