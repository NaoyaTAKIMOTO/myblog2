## Conversation style
R: Liquor and wood go hand in hand.

Tarky: Oh!

R: When you went to a brewery in Taiwan, you saw a row of sake barrels, right? It's a common belief that whiskey tastes different depending on the wood of the barrel.

Tarky: Oh, weren't they burned?

R: Even if it's burned, some things soak in. And Quercus serrata is good. R: Even if it's burned, there's something that soaks in.

Tarky: Is it good?

R: I heard that it has the flavor of the tree. I'm not sure about that, but I'm interested.

Tarky: Do you think it's good?

R: I'd like you to pass it around if you have contacts.

- Liquor and Wood
  - Whiskey barrels
    - Wood
      - Japanese cedar
      - Quercus serrata
    - Processed into barrels, burned on the inside, and then filled with a specific liquor.
      - Sherry barrels, barrels used to prepare wine?
        - Sweet
  - Wood is processed directly into drinking alcohol
    - Structure of wood
      - Cellulose and lignin
      - Equivalent to fibers and what hardens them, like reinforced concrete
      - Structural differences between cellulose and starch, etc.
        - Cellulose is bonded in a fibrous form
    - Lignin is not needed and we want to remove it
    - Previous methods
      - Lignin is dissolved by heating in sodium hydroxide solution.
    - Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute announced a technology for brewing alcohol from cellulose by fermentation[^1].
      - They say it retains the flavor of the wood.
    - So what about in nature?
      - Fungi such as shiitake mushrooms
      - Termites have internal enzymes that digest wood[^2].
      - Ants that grow mushrooms 
    - Conversely, wood was not decomposed until the emergence of these organisms.
      - In the Coal Age, ferns did not decompose and remained as coal until the present day.
  - So is it possible to achieve carbon neutrality with this?
    - Bioethanol and Biodiesel
      - Bioethanol is a fuel
      - Biodiesel is for food
        - Diesel engines are internal combustion engines that can use rapeseed oil as fuel
    - Food supply and the state of the dilemma
      - Should we produce food in sugar cane fields to produce bioethanol?
    - There is a problem of increasing artificiality and food supply
  - As for sustainability and SDGs, I introduced the technology to produce alcohol directly from wood this time as a move to tackle it from the aspect of technological development.
